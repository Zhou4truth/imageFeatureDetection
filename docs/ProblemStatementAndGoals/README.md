# Problem Statement

The folders and files for this folder are as follows:

We need to develop a software to do image processing to dectect some critical features in an image. 
Firstly, the input should be 2d RGB images. In this section, we need to include all sizes of images which would be captured using different devices such as cellphone or professional cameras or just monitoring cameras with different parameters of demensions.
Secondly, the output should be these critical feature detections such as edge detection, canny points dectection and SIFT descriptors detection.
Finally, We need to get an robust outcome in a limited time which means an acceptable efficiency.
