# Problem Statement

In the area of computer vision with image processing, before we do 3d recon-
struction using 2d images which are captured from different angles by the same
camera or by different cameras which are installed in different positions, the
first step is to determine which feature will be used to do the image matching
or registration considering different merits of image features.
To make this step much easier to recognize these features visually, we decided
to develop this software to do the detection of typical features of images such
as edge, corner points, contour, gradients and SIFT descriptor points.
The inputs of this software should be two different images with which it would
be better with overlapped area or captured from adjacent positions. These
images should be captured through optical sensors with RGB formats such as
JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF.
The outputs of this software should be corresponding display of these image fea-
tures in an interface screen with different buttons which are used as indicators
of different detection methods or operations to corresponding image features.
