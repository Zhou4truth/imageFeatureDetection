\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

   The Image Features Detection System  will be tested according to this plan here. This system can be seen as a preliminary step before doing 2d image stitching or 3d image reconstruction. It will use two image as the inputs, and produce image feature points such as corner points, Edge Points, Contour Points, Gradients, and SIFT Feature Points. All these feature points will be used to have first visual judgement before further image processing.


\subsection{Objectives}


The objectives of this system is to use two different images as inputs and then show the feature points of the two images as the outputs generated by those image processing algorithms. There would be a GUI display setting for this system. On this GUI, there would be different buttons which indicate different functions to do image features detection. There should be two windows to show the input images and two windows to their features points on this GUI. With each click of these buttons, the result will be displayed on the GUI.\\

Besides those basic objectives of this system, it also should suffice the requirements of accuracy and usability. The accuracy should be in accordance with verified standards as which here we use MATLAB. The usability means the layout of this system should be user friendly. And the processing time should be in a high efficiency.

\section{Plan}

The plan to do verification and validation will consist of SRS VnV plan, Unit VnV plan, Integration and system VnV plan.

  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}\\

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

For the SRS verification plan, we will apply the experts review as the main method to do this.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

For this part, we will use this checklist as below to do this VnV processï¼š
1. Is this design theoretically workable?
2. Is this design technically feasible?
3. Is this design the best way to solve this problem?
4. What do we need to complete this system as the design plan required? Is the cost worthy?


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

We will apply expert review to do this plan.


\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

For the code part, we will use copilot to the codes check.\\
For the algorithm part, we will use MATLAB to verify.\\
For the GUI and integration part, we will use Qt test to achieve the result.\\


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Here we may use github actions to do the CI/CD monitoring as we will let this project open sourced on github.


\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
   Experts reviews will be considered here. and the algorithm part will be compared with MATLAB.

\section{System Test Description}
The whole system test will be processed in two parts. One is the functional requirements test, and the other is the non-function requirements test.\\
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements consist of GUI test, buttons function test, and display test.
\subsubsection{GUI test}

GUI here should be generate with Qt platform. and the GUI with integrated functions inside should be working accurately and well organized.

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

Accuracy: we will compare the points we got with this system with the outcome we got with MATLAB.\\\\
Usability: we will do a survey to review the usability of this system.\\
